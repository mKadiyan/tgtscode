Cascading is one of the important , backbone and fundamental feature of <code>css</code>.Its the cascading rule that define what should be the final value of
    any property used by the page.
    <br/>
    Since we start discussing <code>cascading</code>, Its the right time to introduce a flag <code>!important</code>.
    This flag enforce that the author style property can't be override in normal way.if user want to override any author property marked with
     <code>!important</code>, then user has to use the <code>!important</code> flag while overriding.
    <br/>
    <br/>
       While overriding any property, cascading work as follows(<strong>1 is least important and 5 is most important</strong>)
    <ol>
        <li>User agent styles (default styles provided by web browser etc.)</li>
        <li>User styles</li>
        <li>Author styles (style library eg. bootstrap.css)</li>
        <li>Author styles flagged as <code>!important</code></li>
        <li>User styles flagged as <code>!important</code></li>
    </ol>
    <br/><br/>
    After parsing of the document, user agent construct a <strong>DOM</strong> tree .After the <strong>DOM</strong> construction, user agent must
    assign the value for each property that are applicable to target media type.
       <br/><br/>
        The final value of a property is calculated in four steps:
    <br/> <br/>
    <details><summary>First, value is determined through specification called <code>specified value</code></summary>
        <p>User agents must first assign a specified value to each property based on the following mechanisms (in order of precedence):</p>
        <ol>
        <li>If the cascade result give a value, use this value.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, if the any property is inherited and the element is not the root of the document tree, use the
                computed value of the parent element.</li>
        <li>Otherwise use the property's initial value.
                The initial value of each property is indicated in the property's definition.</li>
        </ol>
    </details>
    <details><summary>Second, resolved into a value that is used for inheritance called<code>computed value</code>
    </summary>
        <p>
        Specified values are resolved to computed values during the cascade; for example URIs are made absolute and 'em' and 'ex' units are computed to pixel or absolute lengths. Computing a value never requires the user agent to render the document.
        <br/><br/>
        The computed value of URIs that the UA cannot resolve to absolute URIs is the specified value.
            <br/><br/>
        The computed value of a property is determined as specified by the Computed Value line in the definition of the property.
        <br/><br/>
        The computed value exists even when the property does not apply, as defined by the 'Applies To' line. However, some properties may define the computed
             value of a property for an element to depend on whether the property applies to that element.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details><summary>Third, converted into an absolute value if necessary called<code>used value</code></summary>
        <p>Computed values are processed as far as possible without formatting the document. Some values, however,
            can only be determined when the document is being laid out. For example, if the width of an element is set to be a certain percentage of its
            containing block/parent, the width can't be determined until the width of the containing block/parent is determined.
        The used value is the result of taking the computed value and resolving any remaining dependencies into an absolute value.</p>
    </details>
    <details><summary>And Four, finally transformed according to the limitations of the local environment called <code>actual value</code></summary>
        <p>A used value is the value used for rendering of element, but a user agent may not be able to make use of this value in a given environment.
            e.g , a user agent may only be able to render borders with integer pixel widths and may therefore have to approximate the computed width,
            or the user agent may have to use only black and white shades instead of full color.
        At the end , actual value is the used value after any approximations/adjustments have been applied.</p>
