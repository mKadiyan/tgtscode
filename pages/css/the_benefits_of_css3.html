<h2><u>Streamline Design</u></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>Earlier while designing the website, we do use the photoshop or other editor to add the look and feel of a website.This
        process takes more time if new features need to be added or when we try to chnage the design of a website.
        With <code>css 3</code>, We can directly make changes in the web browser and test our new design.
        Whenever a new requirement comes that required a change in design, we can directly modified the css  and new design is ready.
        This is not only easy but also save lot of time required to testing and designing. It works like a magic.

    <h2><u>Reduced Workarounds and Hacks</u></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>
        With the Introduction of <code>css 3</code>, we can do a lot of things with creating a workaround in javascript or html.
        <code>css 3</code> comes with predefined property which we can use to style the webpage.
    </p>
    <p>Some of them are mentioned below : </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rich Web fonts : </strong> Css provide us with many properties using which we can directly play with fonts
        in our webpage.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced additional markup : </strong> With the help of css 3 , we can directly specify some of the property like
            <code>display: table;</code> <code>display: table-cell;</code> <code>display: table-caption;</code> etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Animation : </strong> Css is very rich in providing animation hence reduce heavy scripting needed for animation.</li>
        <li><strong>Gradients on the fly : </strong> We can use pattern and gradient on the fly using css 3.</li>
        <li><strong>Opacity and alpha channels: : </strong> Create transparency without images using <code>opacity</code> or <code>rgba</code>.</li>

        <li><strong>Corners and border styling: : </strong> Using different css property , we can style the border as round or straight
            eg. using <code>border-radius</code> .</li>
